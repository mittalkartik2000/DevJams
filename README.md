A Travel Recommendation System based on Machine Learning.This system features various important aspects of machine learning algorithms for better understanding of concepts.

Neural networks are sources to learn doing machine learning and understand its applications in various fields such that a we feed some data as input to a computer and through modelling it performs the task required. There are n number of examples with respect to this.ay for example an object recognition system like labeled images of cars, plants, dogs, houses, and so on, and through the correlation of the visual patterns of these images, we can easily predict the object of our concern.

In this, we have the travel recommendation system which is meant to use the feature of neural networks using machine learning.Hence, we can say that the artificial networks are used for predictive modeling where they can be trained via a dataset.
